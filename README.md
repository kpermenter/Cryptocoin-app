# cryptoApp
The application will give the user the latest cryptocurrency exchange rate for the most popular coins, and also inform the user of information reguarding the blockchain and the latest crypto headlines.

We used coinapi.io to fetch the data and render it into our application, Bootstrap for our CSS, and particle.js for the splash/entrance page.
